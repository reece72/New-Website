1,Chapter 1 - Processor Components,"<h1>CPU, CU and ALU</h1>
    <p>CPU stands for Central Processing Unit. The CPU is the primary component of a computer that processes instructions. It runs the operating system and applications, 			constantly receiving input from the user or active software programs.</p>
    <p>CU stands for Control Unit and is an integrated circuit in a processor that controls the input and output. It receives instructions from a program, then passes them to
    the arithmetic logic unit ALU.</p>
    <p>ALU stands for Arithmetic Logic Unit and is a digital circuit that is used to perform arithmetic and logic operations. It represents the fundamental building block of 		the central processing unit of a computer. Modern CPUs contain very powerful and complex ALUs.</p>"
